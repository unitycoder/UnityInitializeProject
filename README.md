# UnityInitializeProject

When starting a new project, you always have to do the same things over and over again.. not anymore!


## Usage

- Use with UnityLauncherPro https://github.com/unitycoder/UnityLauncherPro/wiki/Initialize-Project-Script
- Or, copy the [script](https://github.com/unitycoder/UnityInitializeProject/blob/main/Assets/Editor/InitializeProject.cs) into Editor/ folder and run from Tools/UnityLibrary/Initialize Project


### Current Features

- Create common folders (like Scenes, Materials, Prefabs, Scripts..)
- Colorspace to linear
- Save Main scene
- Add scene to build settings
- Set main camera to 0,3,-10
- Disable sceneview camera Easing & Acceleration
- Set 3D gizmos size smaller
- Disable splash screen
- Set company name, product name (TODO need to assign these somewhere..)
- Remove unwanted packages
- Add wanted packages
- NEW: Import your favourite asset store packages (.unitypackage)

*This example script is designed for my own workflows, but you can edit it and use inside Unity or through UnityLauncherPro (when creating new project there).
