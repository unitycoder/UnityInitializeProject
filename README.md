# UnityInitializeProject
Initialize project automatically with script launched from https://github.com/unitycoder/UnityLauncherPro

When starting a new project, you always have to do the same things over and over again.. not anymore!
Common things include:
- Create project folders (Scenes/, Scripts/, Materials/ etc.)
- Setup project settings, company name, Linear vs Gamma, Quality Settings etc.

This example script is designed for my own workflows, but you can edit it and use inside Unity or through UnityLauncherPro (when creating new project there).
