# UnityInitializeProject
Initialize project automatically with script launched from https://github.com/unitycoder/UnityLauncherPro

When starting a new project, you always have to do the same things over and over again.. not anymore!

### Current Features
- Create common folders (like Scenes, Materials, Scripts..)
- Colorspace to linear
- Save Main scene
- Add scene to build settings
- Set main camera to 0,0,0
- Disable sceneview camera Easing & Acceleration
- Set 3D gizmos size smaller
- Disable splash screen
- Set company name, product name (TODO need to assign these somewhere..)

*This example script is designed for my own workflows, but you can edit it and use inside Unity or through UnityLauncherPro (when creating new project there).
